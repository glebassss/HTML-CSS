            <p>Twenty years ago, we began as a small online retailer that only sold shoes. Today, we still sell shoes â€” as well as clothing, handbags, accessories, and more. That "more" is providing the very best customer service, customer experience, and company culture. We aim to inspire the world by showing it's possible to simultaneously deliver happiness to customers, employees, vendors, shareholders, and the community in a long-term, sustainable way.
We hope that in the future people won't even realize we started selling shoes online. Instead, they'll know Zappos as a service company that just happens to sell </p>

        <div class="itext"><p>Writing in his book Business Information: How to Find It, How to Use It, Michael R. Lavin commented that business information is of tremendous value in problem solving and strategic planning: "Information can be used to evaluate the marketplace by surveying changing tastes and needs, monitoring buyers' intentions and attitudes, and assessing the characteristics of the market. Information is critical in keeping tabs on the competition by watching new product developments, shifts in market share, individual company performance, and overall industry trends. Intelligence helps managers anticipate legal and political changes, and monitor economic conditions in the United States and abroad. In short, intelligence can provide answers to two key business questions: How am I doing? and Where am I headed?"</p></div>
        <div class="itext"><p>Many other small business owners, meanwhile, get a considerable amount of their business information from print sources. As with books, entrepreneurs and established business owners (as well as corporate executives, human resource managers, and nearly every other category of person involved in business) can turn to a variety of periodical sources, each with its own target niche. Some magazines and newspapers, such as Business Week and Wall Street Journal, provide general interest coverage, while others (Forbes, Fortune) provide more of an emphasis on subjects of interest to investors and executives in large firms. Still others--most notably Inc. Magazine and Inc.com, Small Business Start-Ups, and Nation's Business (published by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce)--publish information specifically targeted at small business owners.</p></div>
        <div class="itext"><p>Finally, both government agencies and educational institutions publish a wide variety of pamphlets, brochures, and newsletters on a range of issues of interest to small business owners and would-be entrepreneurs. While government brochures and reports have long been a favored source of business information--in some measure because many of these documents are available free of charge--consultants indicate that valuable studies and reports compiled by educational institutions are often underutilized by large and small companies alike.</p></div>
